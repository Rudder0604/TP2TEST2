### Linear Search vs Binary Search

#### Linear Search
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Description**: Linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.
- **Performance**: Linear search is straightforward but can be slow, especially for large datasets, because it may require checking each element in the worst case.
- **Use Case**: Linear search is useful for small or unsorted datasets where implementing more complex algorithms is unnecessary.

#### Binary Search
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Description**: Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides the sorted list in half to narrow down the search. It compares the target value to the middle element of the list and eliminates half of the remaining elements from consideration.
- **Performance**: Binary search is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets because it reduces the search space exponentially with each step.
- **Requirement**: The list must be sorted prior to performing binary search.
- **Use Case**: Binary search is ideal for large, sorted datasets where quick search times are critical.

#### Conclusion
Binary search generally performs faster than linear search due to its logarithmic time complexity, which scales much better with larger datasets. However, it requires the dataset to be sorted. In scenarios where sorting the dataset is impractical or unnecessary, linear search remains a viable, though slower, alternative.
